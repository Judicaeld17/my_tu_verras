## Task

What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
In this project the task is to build a model to predict the houses price based on
predefined criteria using the boston Housing dataset.

## Description

How have you solved the problem?
To solve the problem , we follow two steps.
First we understand and analyse the data. Secondary, we build a Linear Regression Prediction model
Numerous function were wrotten to help us in the above steps, they can be found as following bellow:
`load_dataset()` : Load the data into a DataFrane and return it
`print_summarize_dataset()`: Print the dataset's dimension, first 10 rows and statistical sumary
`clean_dataset()`:Remove any rows with missing values
`compute_correlation_matrix()`: display Pearson's correlations between every pair of attributes
`print_scatter_matrix()`:Plot a scatter matrix showing the relationship between attributes
`boston_fit_model()`: Fit a linear regressionmodel to predict
`boston_predict()`: take a fitted linear regression mosel and an array of input values and return
the predicted values

## Installation

How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
You just need to install Pandas , sklearn , and matplotlib by command line

## Usage

How does it work?
Just need to execute each cell of the jupyter noteboook

```
